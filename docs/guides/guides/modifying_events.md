# Modifying events

Event modification is important to have when we inevitably make mistakes
creating an event or the event details have changed.

Events can be modified in two ways:

- With the `/edit` command
- By clicking the `Edit` button on an event

:::info
To modify a recurring series without affecting an already posted event, the
`/edit` command must be used.
:::

Users can edit events that they've created. Users with the `Manage Server`
Discord permission are able to edit all events on the server.

## Editable attributes

The following event attributes can be modified on an event:

- Title
- Description
- Start time
- Duration
- Recurrence pattern
- Mentions
- Signup option capacity and reminders
- Enable/disable multiple signups
- Restrictions (requires [Premium](https://apollo.fyi/premium))
- Color (requires [Premium](https://apollo.fyi/premium))
- Image (requires [Premium](https://apollo.fyi/premium))
- [Attendee role](attendee_roles.md) (requires [Premium](https://apollo.fyi/premium))

:::warning
Sign up options can not be added or removed from an event at this time.

# Memberships

Subscribing to [Apollo Premium](https://apollo.fyi/premium) grants **memberships** which can
be activated on Discord servers you belong to. The number of memberships you own
depends on your subscription.

Memberships apply to entire Discord servers; anyone
can use Premium features if a server has an active membership.

## Activate a membership

Premium can be activated on a server by using the **`/premium activate`** command.

The command must be issued from the server you'd like to activate Premium on.

:::info
Anyone is able to activate Premium; no special server permissions are needed beyond being
able to use the **`/premium activate`** command.
:::

## View memberships

The **`/premium status`** command shows how many memberships you own and which
servers they're active on.

### Premium verification

The **`/premium check`** command verifies if Premium is active on a server.

:::info
The **`/premium check`** command will tell you if _any_ Premium membership is
active, not just your own.
:::

## Revoke a membership

An active membership can be revoked with the **`/premium revoke`** command.

Unlike activation, memberships can be revoked even if you're no longer a member
of the server.

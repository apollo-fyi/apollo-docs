# Recommended settings

To get the most out of your membership, we recommend enabling a few settings
once you've activated Premium.

You can use the **`/settings overview`** command to view your current settings.

## Temporary attendee roles

Apollo can be configured to assign a temporary role to attendees,
making it possible to message attendees with a single mention.

Apollo will also use temporary attendee roles for event reminders, removing the need
to mention every attendee individually.

Temporary attendee roles can be enabled with the **`/settings temp_roles`** command.

:::info
As temporary attendee roles aren't removed until the event is deleted, we also
recommend enabling **`/settings auto_delete`** to clean up old events.

## Automatic thread joining

When automatic thread joining is enabled, Apollo will **add** and **remove** attendees from
the thread associated with the event. This is a great way to provide a text
channel to discuss upcoming events with other attendees.

Automatic thread joining can be enabled with the **`/settings auto_join_threads`**
command.

We also recommend enabling **`/settings event_threads`** to ensure events
are always created with a thread, as Apollo won't attempt to add an attendee to
a non-existent event thread.

### Private threads

Private threads are more of a personal preference, but automatic thread joining
pairs excellently with private threads.

Apollo ensures that only legitmate event attendees are added to the private
thread; great if you're planning anything sensitive.

Private event threads can be enabled with the **`/settings private_threads`**
command.

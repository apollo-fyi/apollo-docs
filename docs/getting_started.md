# Getting started

Getting started with Apollo is quick and easy.

1. [Invite Apollo to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=475744554910351370&permissions=36776045648&scope=applications.commands%20bot)
2. Create your first event with the [`/event`](/creating-events/) command
    - Apollo will then DM you a list of questions about your event
    - Once finished, Apollo will provide a link to your newly created event
3. RSVP to the event by clicking one of the event buttons

And that's it! You've created your first event with Apollo.

## Reminders

Users who signup for an event will receive a reminder approximately 15 minutes
prior to the scheduled start time.

## Permissions

By default, anyone can create events, though users can only edit and delete
events they own (unless they have the `Manage Server` permission).

To further restrict who can perform various actions, see the `/settings role`
command.

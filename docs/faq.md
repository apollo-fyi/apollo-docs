## How do I change the default time of 15 minutes for reminders?

To configure when event reminders are delivered, use `/settings reminder_interval`.

## How do I prevent members in my server from creating events?

To change the role required to create events, use `/settings role event`. To reset the role, use the command without selecting a role.

## Why are messages being deleted from my event channel?

By default, when a new event is created in an event channel, Apollo deletes all messages in the channel that are not from Apollo or that are not pinned. This is in an attempt to keep the channel clear of non-event messages. This behaviour can be disabled with the `/settings purge` command.

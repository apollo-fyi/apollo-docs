# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Documentation site for the Apollo Discord bot, built with Docusaurus 3.1.1. Production URL: https://docs.apollo.fyi

## Apollo Bot Codebase

The Apollo bot source code is in the sibling directory `../apollo`. Key locations for writing docs:

- `apollo/cogs/` - Discord slash commands organized by feature (event_creation, rsvp, settings, google, premium, etc.)
- `apollo/shared/services/` - Business logic (CreateEvent, AddAttendee, etc.)
- `apollo/shared/entities/` - Data models (Event, User, Guild, Template)
- `locales/` - Translation files showing all user-facing strings

## Commands

```bash
npm start          # Start development server
npm run build      # Build production site
npm run serve      # Serve built site locally
npm run clear      # Clear Docusaurus cache
```

Note: No test or lint commands are configured.

## Architecture

### Content Structure

- `docs/guides/` - User guides (autogenerated sidebar from filesystem)
- `docs/premium/` - Premium feature documentation (autogenerated sidebar)
- `src/pages/commands.mdx` - Commands reference page (standalone, not in sidebar)

### Custom Components

- `docs/figure.jsx` - Image component with captions, used in MDX files:
  ```jsx
  import Figure from '../figure.jsx'
  <Figure src="/img/example.png" caption="Description" />
  ```

### Configuration

- `docusaurus.config.js` - Main config (site metadata, navbar, footer, themes)
- `sidebars.js` - Navigation sidebars (uses `autogenerated` from `guides/` and `premium/` directories)
- Docs are served at root path (`/`) with `routeBasePath: '/'`
- Broken links cause build failures (`onBrokenLinks: 'throw'`)

### Static Assets

- `static/img/` - Images referenced via `/img/` paths in docs
